what is hosting in javascript?
Ans: JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of 
   functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting 
   allows functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

what is memoization: memoization is a technique where, whenever the parent component re-renders, the child
    component re-renders only if there's a change in the props. If there's no change in the props, it won't 
    execute the render method and will return the cached result.

what is useReducers:The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments. useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>) The reducer 
     function contains your custom state logic and the initialState can be a simple value but generally will contain 
     an object. The useReducer Hook returns the current state and a dispatch method.
