Que: WHat is Redux?
Ans: Redux is an open-source library made using the scripting language javascript. Redux's primary use lies in managing and 
centralizing application state and it is usually used along with javascript library.
  a) Redux includes a single store per application. Rether than placing state information in multiple stores across the app,
     redux keeps everything in one region of the application

Que: What is Redux in react js?
Ans: Redux in react is the offical react binding for redux which allows the components in react to read data from a redux store, 
     and dispatch action to the store for updating the data..The purpose of redux is to help application scale well by providing
     means to manage the state via a unidiractional data flow model.

Que: State the core principle of redux?
Ans: a)Single source of truth:the global state of our application is alwayes put away in an object tree inside one store.
     b)The state is read-only: the only way to change the state of our application is by emitting an action, an object 
     explaning what has happend.
     c)Changes are made with pure funcion:this principle means that in order to define how the state tree is being 
     tranceformed by the actions, we have to write pure reducers.

Que:Highlight the key differences between mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps()?
Ans:mapStateToProps(): 1)the mapStateToProps() method is used to render the stored data to the component.
     2)This method's use is to connect the redux state to the props of the react component
   mapDispatchToProps():1)The mapDispatchToProps() method is used to render the action creaters with props to the component.
     2)This method's use is to connect redux actions to the react props

Que: What are reducers in Redux'ss architecture?
Ans: Reducers in Redux's architecture are pure funcions that are used to take the previous state and aaction and return the next state.
     (previous_state, action)=>new_state
