intro:
    I am working in AllTrak Technologies Pvt Ltd as a React developer, I work on a CRM(Customer Relationship Management). 
    which helps to store our rider data, like contact details, address, type etc.. . we create the tasks for rider by which they can work on it, on daily basis. 
    This CRM also track there location and helps our operation team to know that rider are doing there task or not. this also generate 
    reports which we can download as excel sheet. these CRM also gives ability to track leave management system for our riders so our 
    riders can apply for leave after that rider's supervisor can accept it or reject that leave request through our CRM. so I build this CRM from 
    scratch and make this entire project live by 4 month. I manage to solve different problem.
