1: what is Babel ?
Ans:As any language, Javascript also has versions named ECMAScript (short for ES). Currently, most browsers support ES5. 
ES5 used to be good even though it was painful to code in it. Remember, this not reading from inside callback functions? 
The new version of Javascript, ES6, also known as ES2015 (specs of the language were finalized in June 2015) makes Javascript 
great again.All the great features of ES6 come with one big problem — majority of browsers do not fully support them. 
That’s when Babel comes to play. Babel is a JS transpiler that converts new JS code into old ones. It is a very flexible 
tool in terms of transpiling. One can easily add presets such as es2015, es2016, es2017, or env; so that Babel compiles 
them to ES5.

What is Webpack?
Ans: Webpack is a modular build tool that has two sets of functionality — Loaders and Plugins. Loaders transform the source 
    code of a module. For example, style-loader adds CSS to DOM using style tags. sass-loader compiles SASS files to CSS. 
    babel-loader transpiles JS code given the presets. Plugins are the core of Webpack.They can do things that loaders can’t.
    For example, there is a plugin called UglifyJS that minifies and uglifies the output of webpack.

            b) let baked_desserts = ['cake', 'cookie', 'donut'];
                let desserts = ['icecream', 'flan', 'frozen yoghurt', ...baked_desserts];
                console.log(desserts);
                //Appending baked_desserts after flan
                let desserts2 = ['icecream', 'flan', ...baked_desserts, 'frozen yoghurt'];
                console.log(desserts2);

6. What is rest operator?
Ans:Rest parameter: collects all remaining elements into an array.
    function add(...args) {
    let result = 0;
    for (let arg of args) result += arg;
